Semantic Kernel is an open-source SDK that lets you easily combine AI services like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Hugging Face with conventional programming languages like C# and Python. By doing so, you can create AI apps that combine the best of both worlds.

Microsoft powers its Copilot system with a stack of AI models and plugins. At the center of this stack is an AI orchestration layer that allows us to combine AI models and plugins together to create brand new experiences for users.

To help developers build their own Copilot experiences on top of AI plugins, we have released Semantic Kernel, a lightweight open-source SDK that allows you to orchestrate AI plugins. With Semantic Kernel, you can leverage the same AI orchestration patterns that power Microsoft 365 Copilot and Bing in your own apps, while still leveraging your existing development skills and investments.

**Activate GenAI with Azure** uses Semantic Kernel to orchestrate the prompts, Azure OpenAI calls and Azure Cognitive Search queries and results.
